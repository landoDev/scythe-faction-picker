# Scythe Faction Picker

"Scythe is a board game set in an alternate-history 1920S period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and Valor. In scythe, each player represents a fallen leader attempting to restore their honor and lead their faction to power in Eastern Europa." -Stonemeier Games

This project is a web app designed to help a group of players choose which faction they will play the game as. It is helpful for settling disputes over a favored faction or if a player is finding it difficult to choose who to play as.
